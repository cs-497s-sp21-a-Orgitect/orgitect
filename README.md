# orgitect

## Our Idea

This project is designed to help large organizations coordinate multi-step processes. It aims to provide a reasonably generic platform for defining how different departments (organizational units) should proceed to handle a queue of events that should be processed.

## Communication

We are communicating using Discord. Our plan is to meet weekly during the Tuesday class time (as needed) in addition to the Thursday check-ins.
